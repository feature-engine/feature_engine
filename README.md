# Feature Engine

Feature-engine is a Python library that contains several transformers to engineer features for use in machine learning models. Feature-engine's transformers follow Scikit-learn like functionality with fit() and transform() methods to first learn the transforming paramenters from data and then transform the data.
Current Feature-engine's transformers include functionality for:

* Missing data imputation
* Categorical variable encoding
* Outlier removal
* Discretisation
* Numerical Variable Transformation

### Installing

```
pip install feature_engine
```
or

```
git clone https://github.com/solegalli/feature_engine.git
```

### Usage

```
from feature_engine.categorical_encoders import RareLabelEncoder

rare_encoder = RareLabelEncoder(tol = 0.05, n_categories=5)
rare_encoder.fit(data, variables = ['Cabin', 'Age'])
data_encoded = rare_encoder.transform(data)
```

See more usage examples in the jupyter notebooks in the example folder of this repository, or in the documentation: http://feature-engine.readthedocs.io

### Contributing

#### Local Setup Steps
- Clone the repo and cd into it
- Run `pip install tox`
- Run `tox` if the tests pass, your local setup is complete

#### Opening Pull Requests
PR's are welcome! Please make sure the CI tests pass on your branch.

### TODO
- Add flake8, mypy
- Add CI (use tox)
- Add more tests
- Break up test files (and possibly actual files)
- Use fixture for test csv file
- break up tests which test multiple things
- Use VERSION correctly
- Write explanation about each
- Add precommit with black and isort
