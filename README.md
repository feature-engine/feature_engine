Feature-engine is a Python library with multiple transformers to engineer and select features for use in machine learning models. 
Feature-engine's transformers follow scikit-learn's functionality with fit() and transform() methods to first learn the 
transforming parameters from data and then transform the data.

## Installing

From PyPI using pip:

```
pip install feature_engine
```

From Anaconda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge feature_engine

```
Or simply clone it:

```
git clone https://github.com/solegalli/feature_engine.git
```

### Usage

```python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> from feature_engine.encoding import RareLabelEncoder

>>> data = {'var_A': ['A'] * 10 + ['B'] * 10 + ['C'] * 2 + ['D'] * 1}
>>> data = pd.DataFrame(data)
>>> data['var_A'].value_counts()
```

```
Out[1]:
A    10
B    10
C     2
D     1
Name: var_A, dtype: int64
```
    
```python 
>>> rare_encoder = RareLabelEncoder(tol=0.10, n_categories=3)
>>> data_encoded = rare_encoder.fit_transform(data)
>>> data_encoded['var_A'].value_counts()
```

```
Out[2]:
A       10
B       10
Rare     3
Name: var_A, dtype: int64
```

See more usage examples in the Jupyter Notebooks in the **example** folder of this repository, or in the [documentation](http://feature-engine.readthedocs.io).

## Contributing

Details about how to contribute can be found in the [Contributing Page](https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/index.html)

In short:

### Local Setup Steps
- Fork the repo
- Clone your fork into your local computer: ``git clone https://github.com/<YOURUSERNAME>/feature_engine.git``
- cd into the repo ``cd feature_engine``
- Install as a developer: ``pip install -e .``
- Create and activate a virtual environment with any tool of choice
- Install the dependencies as explained in the [Contributing Page](https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/index.html)
- Create a feature branch with a meaningful name for your feature: ``git checkout -b myfeaturebranch``
- Develop your feature, tests and documentation
- Make sure the tests pass
- Make a PR

Thank you!!

### Opening Pull Requests
PR's are welcome! Please make sure the CI tests pass on your branch.

### Tests

We prefer tox. In your environment:

- Run `pip install tox`
- cd into the root directory of the repo: ``cd feature_engine``
- Run `tox` 

If the tests pass, the code is functional.

You can also run the tests in your environment (without tox). For guidelines on how to do so, check the [Contributing Page](https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/index.html).


### Documentation

Feature-engine documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

To build the documentation make sure you have the dependencies installed. From the root directory: ``pip install -r docs/requirements.txt``.

Now you can build the docs: ``sphinx-build -b html docs build``
