Feature-engine is a Python library with multiple transformers to engineer and select features for use in machine learning models. 
Feature-engine's transformers follow Scikit-learn's functionality with fit() and transform() methods to learn the 
transforming parameters from the data and then transform it.

## Installation

From PyPI using pip:

```
pip install feature_engine
```

From Anaconda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge feature_engine
```

Or simply clone it:

```
git clone https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine.git
```

## Example Usage

```python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> from feature_engine.encoding import RareLabelEncoder

>>> data = {'var_A': ['A'] * 10 + ['B'] * 10 + ['C'] * 2 + ['D'] * 1}
>>> data = pd.DataFrame(data)
>>> data['var_A'].value_counts()
```

```
Out[1]:
A    10
B    10
C     2
D     1
Name: var_A, dtype: int64
```
    
```python 
>>> rare_encoder = RareLabelEncoder(tol=0.10, n_categories=3)
>>> data_encoded = rare_encoder.fit_transform(data)
>>> data_encoded['var_A'].value_counts()
```

```
Out[2]:
A       10
B       10
Rare     3
Name: var_A, dtype: int64
```
