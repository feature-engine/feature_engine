==========

Feature-engine is an open source project, originally designed to support the online
course `Feature Engineering for Machine Learning <https://courses.trainindata.com/p/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning>`_,
but has now gained popularity and supports transformations beyond those taught in the
course.

Feature-engine is currently supported by a small community and we will be delighted to
accept contributions, large or small, that you wish to make to the project.
Contributing to open-source is a great way to learn and improve coding skills, and also
a fun thing to do. If you've never contributed to an open source project, we hope to
make it easy for you with the following guidelines.
