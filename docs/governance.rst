Governance
==========

The purpose of this document is to formalize the governance process used by the Feature-engine project and clarify how
decisions are made and how the community works together. This is the first version of our governance policy and will be
updated as our community grows and more of us take on different roles.

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contributors are community members who contribute in various ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and
contributions can be of various forms, not just code. To see how you can help check the `Contributing page <https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html>`_.


Core Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Core Contributors are community members who are dedicated to the continued development of the project through ongoing
engagement with the community. Core Contributors are expected to review code contributions, can merge approved pull
requests, can decide on the fate of pull requests, and can be involved in deciding major changes to the Feature-engine API.

Maintainers can determine who can join as a Core Contributor.


Maintainers
~~~~~~~~~~~

Feature-engine was founded by `Soledad Galli <https://www.trainindata.com/meet-the-team>`_ who at the time was solely responsible
for the initial prototypes, documentation, and dissemination of the project. At the moment, Soledad is the only active
maintainer of the project and will provide the vision, thought leadership, and direction for the project and itâ€™s contributors.
