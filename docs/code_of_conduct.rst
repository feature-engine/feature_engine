Code of Conduct
===============

Feature-engine is an open source Python project. We follow the
`Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct <http://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`_.
All interactions among members of the Feature-engine community must meet those
guidelines. This includes (but is not limited to) interactions through the mailing
list, GitHub and StackOverflow.

Everyone is expected to be open, considerate, and respectful of others no matter what
their position is within the project. We show gratitude for any contribution, big or
small. We welcome feedback and participation. We want to make Feature-engine a nice,
welcoming and safe place for you to do your first contribution to open source, and why
not the second, the third and so on :).
