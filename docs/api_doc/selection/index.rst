Feature Selection
=================

Feature-engine's feature selection transformers are used to drop subsets of variables,
or in other words, to select subsets of variables. Feature-engine hosts selection
algorithms that are, in general, not available in other libraries. These algorithms have
been gathered from data science competitions or used in the industry.

Feature-engine's transformers select features based on 2 strategies. They either select
features by looking at the features intrinsic characteristics, like distributions or their
relationship with other features. Or they select features based on their impact on the
machine learning model performance.

In the following tables you find the algorithms that belong to either category.

Other Feature Selection Libraries
---------------------------------

For additional feature selection algorithms visit the following open-source libraries:

* `Scikit-learn selection <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html>`_
* `MLXtend selection <http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/api_subpackages/mlxtend.feature_selection/>`_

Scikit-learn hosts multiple filter and embedded methods that select features based on
statistical tests or machine learning model derived importance. MLXtend hosts greedy
(wrapper) feature selection methods.
