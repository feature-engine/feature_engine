**Renaming of Modules within Feature-engine**:

Feature-engine transformers have been sorted into submodules to smooth the development
of the package and shorten import syntax for users.

    - **Module imputation**: missing data imputers are now imported from ``feature_engine.imputation`` instead of ``feature_engine.missing_data_imputation``.
    - **Module encoding**: categorical variable encoders are now imported from ``feature_engine.encoding`` instead of ``feature_engine_categorical_encoders``.
    - **Module discretisation**: discretisation transformers are now imported from ``feature_engine.discretisation`` instead of ``feature_engine.discretisers``.
    - **Module transformation**: transformers are now imported from ``feature_engine.transformation`` instead of ``feature_engine.variable_transformers``.
    - **Module outliers**: transformers to remove or censor outliers are now imported from ``feature_engine.outliers`` instead of ``feature_engine.outlier_removers``.
    - **Module selection**: new module hosts transformers to select or remove variables from a dataset.
    - **Module creation**: new module hosts transformers that combine variables into new features using mathematical or other operations.

**Renaming of Classes**:

In this release, we have shortened the name of categorical encoders, and also renamed
other classes of Feature-engine to simplify import syntax.

    - **Encoders**: the word ``Categorical`` was removed from the classes name. Now, instead of ``MeanCategoricalEncoder``, the class is called ``MeanEncoder``. Instead of ``RareLabelCategoricalEncoder`` it is ``RareLabelEncoder`` and so on. Please check the encoders documentation for more details.
    - **Imputers**: the ``CategoricalVariableImputer`` is now called ``CategoricalImputer``.
    - **Discretisers**: the ``UserInputDiscretiser`` is now called ``ArbitraryDiscretiser``.
    - **Creation**: the ``MathematicalCombinator`` is not called ``MathematicalCombination``.
    - **WoEEncoder and PRatioEncoder**: the ``WoEEncoder`` now applies only encoding with the weight of evidence. To apply encoding by probability ratios, use a different transformer: the ``PRatioEncoder`` (**by Nicolas Galli**).

**Renaming of class init Parameters**:

We renamed a few parameters to unify the nomenclature across the Package.

    - **EndTailImputer**: the parameter ``distribution`` is now called ``imputation_method`` to unify convention among imputers. To impute using the IQR, we now need to pass ``imputation_method="iqr"`` instead of ``imputation_method="skewed"``.
    - **AddMissingIndicator**: the parameter ``missing_only`` now takes the boolean values ``True`` or ``False``.
    - **Winzoriser and OutlierTrimmer**: the parameter ``distribution`` is now called ``capping_method`` to unify names across Feature-engine transformers.

**New transformers and classes**:
    - **DropConstantFeatures**: DropConstantFeatures finds and removes constant and quasi-constant features from a dataframe (**by Tejash Shah**)
    - **DropDuplicateFeatures**: DropDuplicateFeatures finds and removes duplicated features from a dataset (**by Tejash Shah and Soledad Galli**)

**Code Architecture - Important for Contributors and Developers**:
    - **Submodules**: transformers have been grouped within relevant submodules and modules.
    - **Individual tests**: testing classes have been subdivided into individual tests
    - **Code Style**: we adopted the use of flake8 for linting and PEP8 style checks, and black for automatic re-styling of code.
    - **Type hint**: we are slowly rolling out the use of type hint throughout Feature-engine classes and functions (**by Nodar Okroshiashvili**)

**Other Changes**:
    - **Updated documentation**: documentation reflects the current use of Feature-engine transformers
    - **Typo fixes**: Thank you to all who contributed to typo fixes (Tim Vink, Github user @piecot)

    - Gleb Levitskiy
    - Karthik Kothareddy
    - Richard Cornelius Suwandi
    - Chris Samiullah
    - Soledad Galli


Major Changes:
    - **New Transformer**: the ``MathematicalCombinator`` allows you combine multiple features into new variables by performing mathematical operations like sum, product, mean, standard deviation, or finding the minimum and maximum values (by Michał Gromiec).
    - **New Transformer**: the ``DropFeatures`` allows you remove specified variables from a dataset (by Karthik Kothareddy).
    - **New Transformer**: the ``DecisionTreeCategoricalEncoder`` encodes categorical variables with a decision tree (by Surya Krishnamurthy).
    - **Bug fix**: the ``SklearnTransformerWrapper`` can now automatically select numerical or numerical and categorical variables depending on the Scikit-learn transformer the user implements (by Michał Gromiec).
    - **Bug fix**: the ``SklearnTransformerWrapper`` can now wrap Scikit-learn's OneHotEncoder and concatenate the binary features back to the original dataframe (by Michał Gromiec).
    - **Added functionality**: the ``ArbitraryNumberImputer`` can now take a dictionary of variable, arbitrary number pairs, to impute different variables with different numbers (by Michał Gromiec).
    - **Added functionality**: the ``CategoricalVariableImputer`` can now replace missing data in categorical variables by a string defined by the user (by Gleb Levitskiy).
    - **Added functionality**: the ``RareLabelEnoder`` now allows the user to determine the maximum number of categories that the variable should have when grouping infrequent values (by Surya Krishnamurthy).


Minor Changes:
    - **Improved docs**: fixed typos and tidy Readme.md (by Richard Cornelius Suwandi)
    - **Improved engineering practices**: added Manifest.in to include md and licenses in tar ball in pypi (by Chris Samiullah)
    - **Improved engineering practices**: updated circleci yaml and created release branch for orchestrated release of new versions with significant changes (by Soledad Galli and Chris Samiullah)

Version 0.5.0
-------------

* Deployed: Friday, July 10, 2020
* Contributors: Soledad Galli

Major Changes:
    - **Bug fix**: fixed error in weight of evidence formula in the ``WoERatioCategoricalEncoder``. The old formula, that is np.log( p(1) / p(0) ) is preserved, and can be obtained by setting the ``encoding_method`` to 'log_ratio'. If ``encoding_method`` is set to 'woe', now the correct formula will operate.
	- **Added functionality**: most categorical encoders have the option ``inverse_transform``, to obtain the original value of the variable from the transformed dataset.
    - **Added functionality**: the `'Winsorizer``, ``OutlierTrimmer`` and ``ArbitraryOutlierCapper`` have now the option to ignore missing values, and obtain the parameters from the original variable distribution, or raise an error if the dataframe contains na, by setting the parameter ``missing_values`` to ``raise`` or ``ignore``.
    - **New Transformer**: the ``UserInputDiscretiser`` allows users to discretise numerical variables into arbitrarily defined buckets.


Version 0.4.3
-------------

* Deployed: Friday, May 15, 2020
* Contributors: Soledad Galli, Christopher Samiullah

Major Changes:
	- **New Transformer**: the `'SklearnTransformerWrapper`` allows you to use most Scikit-learn transformers just on a subset of features. Works with the SimpleImputer, the OrdinalEncoder and most scalers.

Minor Changes:
    - **Added functionality**: the `'EqualFrequencyDiscretiser`` and ``EqualWidthDiscretiser`` now have the ability to return interval boundaries as well as integers, to identify the bins. To return boundareis set the parameter ``return_boundaries=True``.
    - **Improved docs**: added contibuting section, where you can find information on how to participate in the development of Feature-engine's code base, and more.

    - **Improved**: the ``FrequentCategoryImputer`` has now the functionality to return numerical variables cast as object, in case you want to operate with them as if they were categorical. Set ``return_object=True``.
    - **Improved**: the ``RareLabelEncoder`` now allows the user to define the name for the label that will replace rare categories.
    - **Improved**: All feature engine transformers (except missing data imputers) check that the data sets do not contain missing values.
