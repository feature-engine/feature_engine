Math Transformations
====================

Feature-engine's variable transformers transform numerical variables with various
mathematical transformations.

Variable transformations are commonly used to spread the values of the original variables
over a wider value range. See the following illustration:

   :align:   center

**Note**

Note however, that improving the value spread is not always possible and it depends
on the nature of the variable.
