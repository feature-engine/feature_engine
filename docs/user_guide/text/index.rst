Text Feature Extraction
=======================

Feature-engine's text module includes transformers to extract numerical features
from text/string variables.

Text feature extraction is useful for machine learning problems where you have
text data but want to derive numerical statistics without creating sparse
bag-of-words or TF-IDF representations.
