Categorical Encoding
====================

Feature-engine's categorical encoders replace variable strings by estimated or
arbitrary numbers. The following image summarizes the main encoderâ€™s functionality.

   Summary of Feature-engine's encoders main characteristics

Feature-engine's categorical encoders work only with categorical variables by default.
From version 1.1.0, you have the option to set the parameter ignore_format to False,
and make the transformers also accept numerical variables as input.

**Monotonicity**

Most Feature-engine's encoders will return, or attempt to return monotonic relationships
between the encoded variable and the target. A monotonic relationship is one in which
the variable value increases as the values in the other variable increase, or decrease.
See the following illustration as examples:

   :width: 400

Monotonic relationships tend to help improve the performance of linear models and build
shallower decision trees.

**Regression vs Classification**

Most Feature-engine's encoders are suitable for both regression and classification, with
the exception of the :class:`WoEEncoder()` and the :class:`PRatioEncoder()` which are
designed solely for **binary** classification.

**Multi-class classification**

Finally, some Feature-engine's encoders can handle multi-class targets off-the-shelf for
example the :class:`OneHotEncoder()`, the :class:CountFrequencyEncoder()` and the
:class:`DecisionTreeEncoder()`.

Note that while the :class:`MeanEncoder()` and the :class:`OrdinalEncoder()` will operate
with multi-class targets, but the mean of the classes may not be significant and this will
defeat the purpose of these encoding techniques.
