DecisionTreeEncoder
===================

The :class:`DecisionTreeEncoder()` replaces categories in the variable with
the predictions of a decision tree.

The transformer first encodes categorical variables into numerical variables using
:class:`OrdinalEncoder()`. You have the option to have the integers assigned to the
categories as they appear in the variable, or ordered by the mean value of the target
per category. You can regulate this behaviour with the parameter `encoding_method`. As
decision trees are able to pick non-linear relationships, replacing categories by
arbitrary numbers should be enough in practice.

After this, the transformer fits with this numerical variable a decision tree to predict
the target variable. Finally, the original categorical variable is replaced by the
predictions of the decision tree.

The motivation of the :class:`DecisionTreeEncoder()` is to try and create monotonic
relationships between the categorical variables and the target.

Let's look at an example using the Titanic Dataset.

First, let's load the data and separate it into train and test:

.. code:: python

    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from feature_engine.datasets import load_titanic
    from feature_engine.encoding import DecisionTreeEncoder

    X, y = load_titanic(
        return_X_y_frame=True,
        handle_missing=True,
        predictors_only=True,
        cabin="letter_only",
    )

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=0,
    )

    print(X_train[['cabin', 'pclass', 'embarked']].head(10))

We will encode the following categorical variables:

.. code:: python

        cabin  pclass embarked
    501      M       2        S
    588      M       2        S
    402      M       2        C
    1193     M       3        Q
    686      M       3        Q
    971      M       3        Q
    117      E       1        C
    540      M       2        S
    294      C       1        C
    261      E       1        S

We set up the encoder to encode the variables above with 3 fold cross-validation, using
a grid search to find the optimal depth of the decision tree (this is the default
behaviour of the :class:`DecisionTreeEncoder()`). In this example, we optimize the
tree using the roc-auc metric.

.. code:: python

    encoder = DecisionTreeEncoder(
        variables=['cabin', 'pclass', 'embarked'],
        regression=False,
        scoring='roc_auc',
        cv=3,
        random_state=0,
        ignore_format=True)

    encoder.fit(X_train, y_train)

With `fit()` the :class:`DecisionTreeEncoder()` fits 1 decision tree per variable. Now we can go ahead and
transform the categorical variables into numbers, using the predictions of these trees:

.. code:: python

    train_t = encoder.transform(X_train)
    test_t = encoder.transform(X_test)

    train_t[['cabin', 'pclass', 'embarked']].head(10)

We can see the encoded variables below:

.. code:: python

            cabin    pclass  embarked
    501   0.304843  0.436170  0.338957
    588   0.304843  0.436170  0.338957
    402   0.304843  0.436170  0.553073
    1193  0.304843  0.259036  0.373494
    686   0.304843  0.259036  0.373494
    971   0.304843  0.259036  0.373494
    117   0.611650  0.617391  0.553073
    540   0.304843  0.436170  0.338957
    294   0.611650  0.617391  0.553073
    261   0.611650  0.617391  0.338957
