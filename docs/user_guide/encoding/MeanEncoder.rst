MeanEncoder
===========

The :class:`MeanEncoder()` replaces categories with the mean of the target per category.
For example, if we are trying to predict default rate, and our data has the variable city,
with categories, London, Manchester and Bristol, and the default rate per city is 0.1,
0.5, and 0.3, respectively, the encoder will replace London by 0.1, Manchester by 0.5
and Bristol by 0.3.

The motivation is to try and create a monotonic relationship between the target and
the encoded categories. This tends to help improve performance of linear models.

Let's look at an example using the Titanic Dataset.

First, let's load the data and separate it into train and test:

.. code:: python

	import numpy as np
	import pandas as pd
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

	from feature_engine.encoding import MeanEncoder

	# Load dataset
	def load_titanic():
		data = pd.read_csv('https://www.openml.org/data/get_csv/16826755/phpMYEkMl')
		data = data.replace('?', np.nan)
		data['cabin'] = data['cabin'].astype(str).str[0]
		data['pclass'] = data['pclass'].astype('O')
		data['embarked'].fillna('C', inplace=True)
		return data
	
	data = load_titanic()

	# Separate into train and test sets
	X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
			data.drop(['survived', 'name', 'ticket'], axis=1),
			data['survived'], test_size=0.3, random_state=0)

Now, we set up the :class:`MeanEncoder()` to replace the categories only in the 3
indicated variables:

.. code:: python

	# set up the encoder
	encoder = MeanEncoder(variables=['cabin', 'pclass', 'embarked'])

	# fit the encoder
	encoder.fit(X_train, y_train)

With `fit()` the encoder learns the target mean value for each category, which are stored in
its `encoder_dict_` parameter:

.. code:: python

	encoder.encoder_dict_

The `encoder_dict_` contains the mean value of the target per category, per variable.
So we can easily use this dictionary to map the numbers to the original labels.

.. code:: python

	{'cabin': {'A': 0.5294117647058824,
	  'B': 0.7619047619047619,
	  'C': 0.5633802816901409,
	  'D': 0.71875,
	  'E': 0.71875,
	  'F': 0.6666666666666666,
	  'G': 0.5,
	  'T': 0.0,
	  'n': 0.30484330484330485},
	 'pclass': {1: 0.6173913043478261,
	  2: 0.43617021276595747,
	  3: 0.25903614457831325},
	 'embarked': {'C': 0.5580110497237569,
	  'Q': 0.37349397590361444,
	  'S': 0.3389570552147239}}

We can now go ahead and replace the original strings with the numbers:

.. code:: python

	# transform the data
	train_t= encoder.transform(X_train)
	test_t= encoder.transform(X_test)


Handling Cardinality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :class:`MeanEncoder()` replaces categories with the mean of the target per category.
If the variable has low cardinality, then there is a fair representation of each label
in the dataset, and the mean target value per category can be determined with some certainty.
However, if variables are highly cardinal, with only very few observations for some labels,
then the mean target value for those categories will be unreliable.

To encode highly cardinal variables using target mean encoding, we could group
infrequent categories first using the :class:`RareLabelEncoder()`.

Alternatively, the :class:`MeanEncoder()` provides an option to "smooth" the mean target
value estimated for rare categories. In these cases, the target estimates can be determined
as a mixture of two values: the mean target value per category (the posterior) and
the mean target value in the entire dataset (the prior).

.. math::

        mapping = (w_i) posterior + (1-w_i) prior

The two values are “blended” using a weighting factor (wi) which is a function of the category
group size and the variance of the target in the data (t) and within the category (s):

.. math::

    w_i = n_i t / (s + n_i t)

When the category group is large, the weighing factor aroximates 1 and therefore more
weight is given to the posterior. When the category group size is small, then the weight
becomes relevant and more weight is given to the prior.


Finally, you may want to check different implementations of encoding methods that use
blends of probabilities, which are available in the open-source package Category encoders
through the transformers
`M-estimate <https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/mestimate.html>`_ and
`Target Encoder <https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/targetencoder.html>`_.
