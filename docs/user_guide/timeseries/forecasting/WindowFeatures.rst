WindowFeatures
==============

Window features are commonly used in time series forecasting with traditional machine
learning models, like linear regression models. Window features are created by
performing mathematical operations over windows of data.

For example, the mean “sales” value of the previous 3 months of data is a window feature.
The maximum “revenue” of the previous three rows of data is another window feature.

In time series forecasting, we want to predict future values of the time series. To do this,
we can create window features by performing mathematical operations over windows of past
values of the time series data.


Rolling window features with pandas
-----------------------------------

Window features are the result of window operations over the variables. Rolling window operations are
operations that perform an aggregation over a **sliding partition** of past values of the time
series data.

A window feature is, then, a feature created after computing mathematical
functions (e.g., mean, min, max, etc.) within a window over the past data.

In Python, we can create window features by utilizing pandas method `rolling`. For example,
by executing:

.. code:: python

    X[["var_1", "var_2"].rolling(window=3).agg(["max", "mean"])

we create 2 window features for each variable, `var_1` and `var_2`, by taking the maximum and
average value of the current and 2 previous rows of data.

If we want to use those features for forecasting using traditional machine learning algorithms,
we would also shift the window forward with pandas method `shift`:

.. code:: python

    X[["var_1", "var_2"].rolling(window=3).agg(["max", "mean"]).shift(period=1)


Sliding window features with Feature-engine
-------------------------------------------

:class:`WindowFeatures` can automatically create and add window features to the dataframe, by performing
multiple mathematical operations over different window sizes over various numerical variables.

Thus, :class:`WindowFeatures` creates and adds new features to the data set automatically
through the use of windows over historical data.

Window features: parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create window features we need to determine a number of parameters. First, we need to
identify the size of the window or windows in which we will perform the operations. For
example, we can take the average of the variable over 3 months, or 6 weeks.

We also need to determine how far back is the window located respect to the data point we
want to forecast. For example, I can take the average of the last 3 weeks of data to forecast
this week of data, or I can take the average of the last 3 weeks of data to forecast next
weeks data, leaving a gap of a window in between the window feature and the forecasting point.

WindowFeatures: under the hood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:class:`WindowFeatures` works on top of `pandas.rolling`, `pandas.aggregate` and
`pandas.shift`. With `pandas.rolling`, :class:`WindowFeatures` determines the size
of the windows for the operations. With `pandas.rolling` we can specify the window size
with an integer, a string or a function. With :class:`WindowFeatures`, in addition, we
can pass a list of integers, strings or functions, to perform computations over multiple
window sizes.

:class:`WindowFeatures` uses `pandas.aggregate` to perform the mathematical operations
over the windows. Therefore, you can use any operation supported
by pandas. For supported aggregation functions, see Rolling Window
`Functions <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/window.html>`_.

With `pandas.shift`, :class:`WindowFeatures` places the value derived from the past
window, at the place of the value that we want to forecast. So if we want to forecast
this week with the average of the past 3 weeks of data, we should shift the value 1
week forward. If we want to forecast next week with the last 3 weeks of data, we should
forward the value 2 weeks forward.

:class:`WindowFeatures` will add the new features with a representative name to the
original dataframe. It also has the methods `fit()` and `transform()` that make it
compatible with the Scikit-learn's `Pipeline` and cross-validation functions.

Note that, in the current implementation, :class:`WindowFeatures` only works with dataframes whose index,
containing the time series timestamp, contains unique values and no NaN.

Examples
--------

Let's create a toy time series dataset to demonstrate the functionality of :class:`WindowFeatures`.
The dataframe contains 3 numerical variables, a categorical variable, and a datetime
index.

.. code:: python

    import pandas as pd

    X = {"ambient_temp": [31.31, 31.51, 32.15, 32.39, 32.62, 32.5, 32.52, 32.68],
         "module_temp": [49.18, 49.84, 52.35, 50.63, 49.61, 47.01, 46.67, 47.52],
         "irradiation": [0.51, 0.79, 0.65, 0.76, 0.42, 0.49, 0.57, 0.56],
         "color": ["green"] * 4 + ["blue"] * 4,
         }

    X = pd.DataFrame(X)
    X.index = pd.date_range("2020-05-15 12:00:00", periods=8, freq="15min")

    X.head()

Below we see the output of our toy dataframe:

.. code:: python

                         ambient_temp  module_temp  irradiation  color
    2020-05-15 12:00:00         31.31        49.18         0.51  green
    2020-05-15 12:15:00         31.51        49.84         0.79  green
    2020-05-15 12:30:00         32.15        52.35         0.65  green
    2020-05-15 12:45:00         32.39        50.63         0.76  green
    2020-05-15 13:00:00         32.62        49.61         0.42   blue



Now we will create window features from the numerical variables. By setting
`window=["30min", "60min"]` we perform calculations over windows of 30 and 60
minutes, respectively.

If you look at our toy dataframe, you'll notice that 30 minutes corresponds to 2 rows of
data, and 60 minutes are 4 rows of data. So, we will perform calculations over 2 and then
4 rows of data, respectively.

In `functions`, we indicate all the operations that we want to perform over those windows.
In our example below, we want to calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the
data within those windows and also find the maximum value within the windows.

With `freq="15min"` we indicate that we need to shift the calculations 15 minutes
forward. In other words, we are using the data available in windows defined up to 15 minutes
before the forecasting point.

.. code:: python

    from feature_engine.timeseries.forecasting import WindowFeatures

    win_f = WindowFeatures(
        window=["30min", "60min"], functions=["mean", "max", "std"], freq="15min",
    )

    X_tr = win_f.fit_transform(X)

    X_tr.head()

We can find the window features on the right side of the dataframe.

The variables used as input for the window features are stored in the `variables_`
attribute of the :class:`WindowFeatures`:

.. code:: python

    win_f.variables_

.. code:: python

    ['ambient_temp', 'module_temp', 'irradiation']

We can obtain the names of the variables in the returned dataframe using the
get_feature_names_out() method:

.. code:: python

    win_f.get_feature_names_out()

.. code:: python

    ['ambient_temp',
     'module_temp',
     'irradiation',
     'color',
     'ambient_temp_window_30min_mean',
     'ambient_temp_window_30min_max',
     'ambient_temp_window_30min_std',
     'module_temp_window_30min_mean',
     'module_temp_window_30min_max',
     'module_temp_window_30min_std',
     'irradiation_window_30min_mean',
     'irradiation_window_30min_max',
     'irradiation_window_30min_std',
     'ambient_temp_window_60min_mean',
     'ambient_temp_window_60min_max',
     'ambient_temp_window_60min_std',
     'module_temp_window_60min_mean',
     'module_temp_window_60min_max',
     'module_temp_window_60min_std',
     'irradiation_window_60min_mean',
     'irradiation_window_60min_max',
     'irradiation_window_60min_std']


Working with pandas series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your time series is a pandas Series instead of a pandas Dataframe, you need to
transform it into a dataframe before using :class:`WindowFeatures`.

The following is a pandas Series:

.. code:: python

We can use :class:`WindowFeatures` to create, for example, 2 new window features by finding
the mean and maximum value within a 45 minute windows of a pandas Series if we convert it
to a pandas Dataframe using the method `to_frame()`:

.. code:: python

    win_f = WindowFeatures(
        window=["45min"],
        functions=["mean", "max"],
        freq="30min",
    )

    X_tr = win_f.fit_transform(X['ambient_temp'].to_frame())

    X_tr.head()

.. code:: python

                         ambient_temp  ambient_temp_window_45min_mean  \
    2020-05-15 12:00:00         31.31                             NaN
    2020-05-15 12:15:00         31.51                             NaN
    2020-05-15 12:30:00         32.15                       31.310000
    2020-05-15 12:45:00         32.39                       31.410000
    2020-05-15 13:00:00         32.62                       31.656667

                         ambient_temp_window_45min_max
    2020-05-15 12:00:00                            NaN
    2020-05-15 12:15:00                            NaN

    2020-05-15 13:00:00                          32.15


And if we do not want the original values of time series in the returned dataframe, we
just need to remember to drop the original series after the transformation:

.. code:: python

    win_f = WindowFeatures(
        window=["45min"],
        functions=["mean", "max"],
        freq="30min",
        drop_original=True,
    )

    X_tr = win_f.fit_transform(X['ambient_temp'].to_frame())

    X_tr.head()

.. code:: python

                         ambient_temp_window_45min_mean  \
    2020-05-15 12:00:00                             NaN
    2020-05-15 12:15:00                             NaN
    2020-05-15 12:30:00                       31.310000
    2020-05-15 12:45:00                       31.410000
    2020-05-15 13:00:00                       31.656667

                         ambient_temp_window_45min_max
    2020-05-15 12:00:00                            NaN
    2020-05-15 12:15:00                            NaN
    2020-05-15 12:30:00                          31.31
    2020-05-15 12:45:00                          31.51
    2020-05-15 13:00:00                          32.15



Getting the name of the new features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can easily obtain the name of the original and new variables with the method
`get_feature_names_out`. By using the method with the default parameters, we obtain
all the features in the output dataframe.

.. code:: python

    win_f = WindowFeatures()

    win_f.fit(X)

    win_f.get_feature_names_out()

.. code:: python

    ['ambient_temp',
     'module_temp',
     'irradiation',
     'color',
     'ambient_temp_window_3_mean',
     'module_temp_window_3_mean',
     'irradiation_window_3_mean']


Windows from the target vs windows from predictor variables
-----------------------------------------------------------

Very often, we work with univariate time series, for example, the total sales revenue of a
retail company. We want to forecast future sales values. The sales variable is our target
variable, and we can extract features from windows of past sales values.

We could also work with multivariate time series, where we have sales in different
countries, or alternatively, multiple time series, like pollutant concentration in the
air, accompanied by concentrations of other gases, temperature, and humidity.

When working with multivariate time series, like sales in multiple countries, we would
extract features from windows of past data for each country separately.

When working with multiple time series, like pollutant concentration, gas concentration,
temperature, and humidity, pollutant concentration is our target variable, and the other
time series are accompanying predictive variables. We can create window features from
past pollutant concentrations, that is, from past time steps of our target variable.
And, in addition, we can create features from windows of past data from accompanying
time series, like the concentrations of other gases or the temperature or humidity.
