In this version, we made a major overhaul of the package, with code quality improvement
throughout the code base, unification of attributes and methods, addition of new
transformers and extended documentation. Read below for more details.

New transformers for Feature Selection
--------------------------------------

We included a whole new module with multiple transformers to select features.

    - **DropConstantFeatures**: removes constant and quasi-constant features from a dataframe (**by Tejash Shah**)
    - **DropDuplicateFeatures**: removes duplicated features from a dataset (**by Tejash Shah and Soledad Galli**)
    - **DropCorrelatedFeatures**: removes features that are correlated (**by Nicolas Galli**)
    - **SmartCorrelationSelection**: selects feature from group of correlated features based on certain criteria (**by Soledad Galli**)
    - **ShuffleFeaturesSelector**: selects features by drop in machine learning model performance after feature's values are randomly shuffled (**by Sana Ben Driss**)
    - **SelectBySingleFeaturePerformance**: selects features based on a ML model performance trained on individual features (**by Nicolas Galli**)
    - **SelectByTargetMeanPerformance**: selects features encoding the categories or intervals with the target mean and using that as proxy for performance (**by Tung Lee and Soledad Galli**)
    - **RecursiveFeatureElimination**: selects features recursively, evaluating the drop in ML performance, from the least to the most important feature (**by Sana Ben Driss**)
    - **RecursiveFeatureAddition**: selects features recursively, evaluating the increase in ML performance, from the most to the least important feature (**by Sana Ben Driss**)


Renaming of Modules
-------------------

Feature-engine transformers have been sorted into submodules to smooth the development
of the package and shorten import syntax for users.

    - **Module imputation**: missing data imputers are now imported from ``feature_engine.imputation`` instead of ``feature_engine.missing_data_imputation``.
    - **Module encoding**: categorical variable encoders are now imported from ``feature_engine.encoding`` instead of ``feature_engine_categorical_encoders``.
    - **Module discretisation**: discretisation transformers are now imported from ``feature_engine.discretisation`` instead of ``feature_engine.discretisers``.
    - **Module transformation**: transformers are now imported from ``feature_engine.transformation`` instead of ``feature_engine.variable_transformers``.
    - **Module outliers**: transformers to remove or censor outliers are now imported from ``feature_engine.outliers`` instead of ``feature_engine.outlier_removers``.
    - **Module selection**: new module hosts transformers to select or remove variables from a dataset.
    - **Module creation**: new module hosts transformers that combine variables into new features using mathematical or other operations.

Renaming of Classes
-------------------

We shortened the name of categorical encoders, and also renamed other classes to
simplify import syntax.

    - **Encoders**: the word ``Categorical`` was removed from the classes name. Now, instead of ``MeanCategoricalEncoder``, the class is called ``MeanEncoder``. Instead of ``RareLabelCategoricalEncoder`` it is ``RareLabelEncoder`` and so on. Please check the encoders documentation for more details.
    - **Imputers**: the ``CategoricalVariableImputer`` is now called ``CategoricalImputer``.
    - **Discretisers**: the ``UserInputDiscretiser`` is now called ``ArbitraryDiscretiser``.
    - **Creation**: the ``MathematicalCombinator`` is not called ``MathematicalCombination``.
    - **WoEEncoder and PRatioEncoder**: the ``WoEEncoder`` now applies only encoding with the weight of evidence. To apply encoding by probability ratios, use a different transformer: the ``PRatioEncoder`` (**by Nicolas Galli**).

Renaming of Parameters
----------------------

We renamed a few parameters to unify the nomenclature across the Package.

    - **EndTailImputer**: the parameter ``distribution`` is now called ``imputation_method`` to unify convention among imputers. To impute using the IQR, we now need to pass ``imputation_method="iqr"`` instead of ``imputation_method="skewed"``.
    - **AddMissingIndicator**: the parameter ``missing_only`` now takes the boolean values ``True`` or ``False``.
    - **Winzoriser and OutlierTrimmer**: the parameter ``distribution`` is now called ``capping_method`` to unify names across Feature-engine transformers.

For Contributors and Developers
-------------------------------

Code Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - **Submodules**: transformers have been grouped within relevant submodules and modules.
    - **Individual tests**: testing classes have been subdivided into individual tests
    - **Code Style**: we adopted the use of flake8 for linting and PEP8 style checks, and black for automatic re-styling of code.
    - **Type hint**: we rolled out the use of type hint throughout classes and functions (**by Nodar Okroshiashvili, Soledad Galli and Chris Samiullah**)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Switched fully to numpydoc and away from Napoleon
    - Included more detail about methods, parameters, returns and raises, as per numpydoc docstring style (**by Nodar Okroshiashvili, Soledad Galli**)
    - Linked documentation to github repository
    - Improved layout

Other Changes
-------------

    - **Updated documentation**: documentation reflects the current use of Feature-engine transformers
    - **Typo fixes**: Thank you to all who contributed to typo fixes (Tim Vink, Github user @piecot)
