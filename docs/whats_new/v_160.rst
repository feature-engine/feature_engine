In this release, we make Feature-engine transformers compatible with the `set_output`
API from Scikit-learn, which was released in version 1.2.0. We also make Feature-engine
compatible with the newest direction of pandas, in removing the `inplace` functionality
that our transformers use under the hood.

We introduce a major change: most of the **categorical encoders can now encode variables
even if they have missing data**.

We are also releasing **3 brand new transformers**: One for discretization, one for feature
selection and one for operations between datetime variables.

We also made a major improvement in the performance of the `DropDuplicateFeatures` and some
smaller bug fixes here and there.

We'd like to thank all contributors for fixing bugs and expanding the functionality
and documentation of Feature-engine.

Thank you so much to all contributors and to those of you who created issues flagging bugs or
requesting new functionality.

New transformers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **ProbeFeatureSelection**: introduces random features and selects variables whose importance is greater than the random ones (`Morgan Sell <https://github.com/Morgan-Sell>`_ and `Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- **DatetimeSubtraction**: creates new features by subtracting datetime variables (`Kyle Gilde <https://github.com/kylegilde>`_ and `Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- **GeometricWidthDiscretiser**: sorts continuous variables into intervals determined by geometric progression (`Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_)

New functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Allow categorical encoders to encode variables with NaN (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- Make transformers compatible with new `set_output` functionality from sklearn (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- The `ArbitraryDiscretiser()` now includes the lowest limits in the intervals (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)

New modules
~~~~~~~~~~~

- New **Datasets** module with functions to load specific datasets (`Alfonso Tobar <https://github.com/datacubeR>`_)
- New **variable_handling** module with functions to auomatically select numerical, categorical, or datetime variables (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bug in `DropFeatures()` (`Luís Seabra  <https://github.com/luismavs>`_)
- Fixed bug in `RecusriveFeatureElimination()` caused when only 1 feature remained in data (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add example code snippets to the selection module API docs (`Alfonso Tobar <https://github.com/datacubeR>`_)
- Updated documentation using new Dataset module (`Alfonso Tobar <https://github.com/datacubeR>`_ and `Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- Reorganized Readme badges (`Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_)
- New Jupyter notebooks for `GeometricWidthDiscretiser` (`Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_)
- Fixed typos (`Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_)
- Remove examples using the boston house dataset (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- Fix sponsor page, expand contribute page (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The class `PRatioEncoder` is no longer supported and was removed from the API (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)

Code improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
