In this release, we make all Feature-engine transformers compatible with the `set_output`
API from Scikit-learn, which was released in version 1.2.0.

In addition, most of the categorical encoders can now encode variables even if they have
missing data.

Thanks to `Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_, we've got a new discretiser
to sort continuous variables into intervals determined by geometric progression.

`Nodar Okroshiashvili <https://github.com/Okroshiashvili>`_ made a major improvement in the
performance of the `DropDuplicateFeatures`.

Finally, we'd like to thank all contributors for fixing bugs and expanding the functionality
and documentation of Feature-engine.

Thank you so much to all contributors and to those of you who created issues flagging bugs or
requesting new functionality.
