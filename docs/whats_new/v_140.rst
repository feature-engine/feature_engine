In this release, we fix a major bug that was preventing you guys from using the new module
introduced in version 1.3: timeseries. We basically, forgot to add the __init__ file and
for some reason, we did not pick up this error from our development environments. Thank you
`Brice <https://github.com/BriceChivu>`_ for reporting this very important issue.

In addition, we updated our code base to work with the latest release of Scikit-learn (1.1.1)
and pandas (1.4.2), which means that like Scikit-learn, we no longer support Python 3.7.

We are delaying the complete deprecation of `MathematicalCombination`, `CombineWithFeatureReference`,
and `CyclicalTransformer` to our next release (1.5), as this release is a bit short notice,
to give you more time to adapt your code bases.

In addition, we've added a new transformer, a number of new badges and made some
enhancements to our code base.

I am very happy to announce that for this release, we had a number of contributions from
**first time contributors**. Thank you so much for your support!

Thank you so much to all contributors to this release for making it possible!

New transformers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - **ArcsinTransformer**: transforms variables with the arcsin transformation: arcsin(sqrt(x)) (`tomtom-95 <https://github.com/tomtom-95>`_)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - The `SklearnTransformerWrapper` now accepts categorical variables when used with the FunctionTransformer (`Fernando Barbosa  <https://github.com/nandevers>`_)
    - Added init file to allow import of time series module (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Add Yeo-Johnson article as reference (`Sangam <https://github.com/SangamSwadiK>`_)
    - Add first timers friendly badge (`Swati A Firangi <https://github.com/Safirangi>`_)
    - Fixed source of logo in readme (`Mohamed Emad <https://github.com/iMezemz>`_)


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - We are extending the complete deprecation of `MathematicalCombination`, `CombineWithFeatureReference` and `CyclicalTransformer` to version 1.5


Code improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Improved message returned when y is not what expected (following sklearn 1.1.1)  (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
    - Introduced check for some selectors to ensure user passes more than 1 variable (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)


For developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - We broke down base categorical classes into MixIns (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
    - Accommodated lack of future pandas support for sets as indexers (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
