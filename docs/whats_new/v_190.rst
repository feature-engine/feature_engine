In this release, we expand the functionality of 3 feature selection transformers: `ProbeFeatureSelection()`,
`RecursiveFeatureAddition()` and `RecursiveFeatureElimination()`.

`ProbeFeatureSelection()` can now create probes with additional distributions, and also
combine the probes using the mean, max or mean plus standard deviation.

`RecursiveFeatureAddition()` and `RecursiveFeatureElimination()` now work with all sklearn
estimators, regardless of whether they return feature importance or coefficients. For those
without these features, importance is determined by feature permutaton.

Thanks to all contributors who made this possible either by contributing code or raising issues.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added 2 additional distributions, discrete uniform and Poisson, to create probes in `ProbeFeatureSelection()`.
- Expanded `ProbeFeatureSelection()`'s functionality to obtain the mean, max or mean plus std of random probes.
- Expanded `RecursiveFeatureAddition()` and `RecursiveFeatureElimination()`'s functionality to support estimators without feature importance or coefficients.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed fragmented dataframe warning in `DecisionTreeFeatures()`.
- Replaced default sorting method by merge_sort in `SmartCorrelatedSelection()`. (`Claudio Salvatore Arcidiacono <https://github.com/ClaudioSalvatoreArcidiacono>`_)

Code maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Migrated various config files to pyproject.toml. (`Franz Király  <https://github.com/fkiraly>`_)
- Added support for Python 3.13.
- Added support for Python 3.14.

Docs
~~~~

- Updated doscstings for `DropHighPSIFeatures` to reflect the fact that the PSI is symmetric but our implementation is not. (`Sancho Luijten  <https://github.com/sancholp>`_)
