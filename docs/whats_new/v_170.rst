The biggest addition in this version is the introduction of a `Pipeline` that supports transformers that remove rows
from the dataset during the data transformation.

In addition, transformers that remove rows from the dataset, can now adjust the target value to the remaining rows
through the new method `transform_x_y`.

Other than that, we did a lot of work to catch up with the latest developments of Scikit-learn and pandas, to ensure
that our transformers keep on being compatible.

New functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We now have a `Pipeline()` and `make_pipeline` that support transformers that remove rows from the dataset (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- `DropMissingData`, `OutlierTrimmer`, `LagFeatures`, `ExpandingWindowFeatures` and `WindowFeatures` have the method `transform_x_y` to remove rows from the data and then adjust the target variable (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `DropCorrelatedFeatures()` and `SmartCorrelationSelection` have a new attribute to indicate which feature will be retained from each correlated group (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_, `dlaprins <https://github.com/dlaprins>`_)
- `LagFeatures` can now impute the introduced nan values (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- `DropCorrelatedFeatures()` and `SmartCorrelationSelection` are now deterministic (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_, `Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_, `dlaprins <https://github.com/dlaprins>`_)

In addition to these bug fixes, we fixed other pandas, and scikit-learn new version and deprecation
related bugs.

Code improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `DropCorrelatedFeatures()` and `SmartCorrelationSelection` are faster (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_, `Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_, `dlaprins <https://github.com/dlaprins>`_)
- Improves logic to select the variables to examine in all feature selection transformers (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- Add circleCI tests for python 3.11 and 3.12 (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_, `Chris Samiullah <https://github.com/christophergs>`_)
