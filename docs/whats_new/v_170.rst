There are a few big additions in this new release. First, we introduce a new `Pipeline` that supports transformers that remove rows
from the dataset during the data transformation. From now on, you can use `DropMissingData`, `OutlierTrimmer`, `LagFeatures`
and `WindowFeatures` as part of a feature engineering pipeline that will transform your variables, re-align the target to
the remaining rows if necessary, and then fit a model. All in one go!

In addition, transformers that remove rows from the dataset, like `DropMissingData`, `OutlierTrimmer`, `LagFeatures`
and `WindowFeatures`, can now adjust the target value to the remaining rows through the new method `transform_x_y`.

The third big improvement consists in a massive speed optimization of our correlation transformers, which now
find and remove correlated features at doble the speed, and also, let you easily identify the feature against
which the correlated ones were determined.

Other than that, we did a lot of work to catch up with the latest developments of Scikit-learn and pandas, to ensure
that our transformers keep on being compatible. That being said, we are a small team and maintenance is hard for us,
so we've deprecated support of earlier releases of these libraries.

Read on to find out more what we've been up to!

New functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We now have a `Pipeline()` and `make_pipeline` that support transformers that remove rows from the dataset (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- `DropMissingData`, `OutlierTrimmer`, `LagFeatures`, `ExpandingWindowFeatures` and `WindowFeatures` have the method `transform_x_y` to remove rows from the data and then adjust the target variable (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `DropCorrelatedFeatures()` and `SmartCorrelationSelection` have a new attribute to indicate which feature will be retained from each correlated group (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_, `dlaprins <https://github.com/dlaprins>`_)
- `DropCorrelatedFeatures()` and `SmartCorrelationSelection` are twice as fast and can sort variables based on variance, cardinality or alphabetically before the search (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_, `dlaprins <https://github.com/dlaprins>`_)
- `LagFeatures` can now impute the introduced nan values (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- `DropCorrelatedFeatures()` and `SmartCorrelationSelection` are now deterministic (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_, `Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_, `dlaprins <https://github.com/dlaprins>`_)

In addition to these bug fixes, we fixed other pandas, and scikit-learn new version and deprecation
related bugs.
