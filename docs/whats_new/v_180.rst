In this release, we make some breaking changes. The `DecisionTreeEncoder()` does not have the encoding pipeline any more.
In its place, we now added an `encoding_dict_` parameter that stores the mappings from category to predictions of the
decision tree. This allowed us to implement in addition a way to handle unseen categories and the method `inverse_transform`.

We also expanded the functionality of the `DecisionTreeDiscretiser()`, which can now replace the continuous attributes
with the decision tree predictions, interval limits, or bin number.

In addition, we introduce a new transformer, the `DecisionTreeFreatures()`, which adds new features to the data,
resulting from predictions of decision trees trained on one or more features.

The classes from the module `outliers` can now automatically select the limit for the boundaries for outliers.

Finally, we have updated and expanded various pages of our documentation.

Thank you very much to all contributors to this release and to `Vasco Schiavo <https://github.com/VascoSch92>`_ and
`Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_ for actively reviewing many of our PRs.

updating Feature-engine at a fast pace.

New
~~~

- `DecisionTreeFeatures` is a new transformer from the creation module that adds features based of predictions of decision trees (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `DecisionTreeEncoder` now supports encodings for unseen categories, `inverse_transform`, and provides an encoding dictionary instead of the pipeline (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_, `Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_ and `Lorenzo Vitali <https://github.com/93lorenzo>`_ )
- The `DecisionTreeDiscretiser()` can now replace the continuous attributes with the decision tree predictions, interval limits, or bin number (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- The `OutlierTrimmer()` and `Winsorizer()` can now adjust the strength of the outlier search automatically based of the statistical method (param `fold="auto"`) (`Gleb Levitski <https://github.com/GLevv>`_)
