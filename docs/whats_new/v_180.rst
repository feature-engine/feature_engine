In this release, we add 2 new transformers: A transformer to select features based on the
MRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) framework, and a transformer to implement
mean normalization.

Mean normalization is a scaling procedure not supported by Scikit-learn, so we thought we'd
give it a go ourselves. MRMR is a feature selection method made quite popular by Uber,
probably because it is quite fast to compute.

In addition, we added some new functionality and expanded the documentation of the Forecasting features
transformers.

Thank you very much to all contributors to this release!

If you value what we do, consider `sponsoring us <https://github.com/sponsors/solegalli>`_, so that we can keep
updating Feature-engine at a fast pace.

New transformers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `MRMR()` selects features based on the Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy framework (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- `MeanNormalizationScaler()` scales features using mean normalization which consists of subtracting the mean and dividing by the value range (`Vasco Schiavo <https://github.com/VascoSch92>`_)


Code improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add tz aware columns to variable handling functions, useful for datetime module transformers (`JCCalvoJackson <https://github.com/jccalvojackson>`_)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Expand user guide for the forecasting features transformer (`Gurjinder Kaur <https://github.com/gurjinderbassi>`_)
- Fix parameter default value of `DecisionTreeEncoder()` (Michael Russell <https://github.com/michaelrussell4>`_)

In this release, we fix several bugs and future deprecation warnings from pandas and numpy.
In addition, we expand the functionality of some feature selection classes to return the standard
deviation of the derived feature importance.

We have also updated and expanded various pages of our documentation.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `ProbeFeatureSelection` can now also determine feature importance through single feature model performance (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- `ProbeFeatureSelection` can now return the standard deviation of the feature importance (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- `RecursiveFeatureElimination` and `RecursiveFeatureAddition` can now return the standard deviation of the feature importances (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- `SelectByShuffling`, `SelectBySingleFeaturePerformance` and `SelectByTargetMeanPerformance` can now return the standard deviation of the feature importances (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- All feature selection classes can now implement Group cross-validation through the `groups` parameter (`Kanan Mahammadli <https://github.com/KananMahammadli>`_)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The cv parameter of the recursive feature selectors can now take cv generators of the type `KFold.split(X, y)` (`Alessandro Benetti <https://github.com/Benetti-Hub>`_)
- The cv parameter of the remaining feature selection classes can now take cv generators of the type `KFold.split(X, y)` (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- `LogCpTransformer()` adds a constant only to those variables that are strictly non-positive during fit (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)
- Fix bug in `MatchVariables` that was preventing the transformer to work when missing values were raised (`Soledad Galli <https://github.com/solegalli>`_)

In this release, we make some breaking changes. The `DecisionTreeEncoder()` does not have the encoding pipeline any more.
In its place, we now added an `encoding_dict_` parameter that stores the mappings from category to predictions of the
decision tree. This allowed us to implement in addition a way to handle unseen categories and the method `inverse_transform`.

We also expanded the functionality of the `DecisionTreeDiscretiser()`, which can now replace the continuous attributes
with the decision tree predictions, interval limits, or bin number.

In addition, we introduce a new transformer, the `DecisionTreeFreatures()`, which adds new features to the data,
resulting from predictions of decision trees trained on one or more features.

The classes from the module `outliers` can now automatically select the limit for the boundaries for outliers.

Finally, we have updated and expanded various pages of our documentation.
