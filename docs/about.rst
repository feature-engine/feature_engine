About
=====

History
-------

Data scientists spend a huge amount of time on data pre-processing and transformation.
It would be great (we thought back in the day) to gather the most frequently used data
pre-processing techniques and transformations in a library, from which we could pick
and choose the transformation that we need, and use it just like we would use any other
sklearn class. This was the original vision for Feature-engine.

Feature-engine is an open source Python package originally designed to support the online
course `Feature Engineering for Machine Learning in Udemy <https://www.udemy.com/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning/?couponCode=FEATENGREPO>`_,
but has now gained popularity and supports transformations beyond those taught in the
course. It was launched in 2017, and since then, several releases have appeared and a
growing international community is beginning to lead the development.
