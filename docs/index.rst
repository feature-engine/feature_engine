Feature-engine: A Python library for Feature Engineering for Machine Learning
=============================================================================

   Feature-engine rocks!

Feature-engine is a Python library with multiple transformers to engineer features for
use in machine learning models. Feature-engine preserves Scikit-learn functionality with
methods `fit()` and `transform()` to learn parameters from and then transform the data.

Feature-engine includes transformers for:

- Missing data imputation
- Categorical variable encoding
- Discretisation
- Variable transformation
- Outlier capping or removal
- Variable creation
- Variable selection

Feature-engine allows you to select the variables you want to transform within each
transformer. This way, different engineering procedures can be easily applied to
different feature subsets.

Feature-engine transformers can be assembled within the Scikit-learn pipeline,
therefore making it possible to save and deploy one single object (.pkl) with the
entire machine learning pipeline. That is, one object with the entire sequence of
variable transformations to leave the raw data ready to be consumed by a machine
learning algorithm, and the machine learning model at the back. Check the **quickstart**
for an example.

Installation
------------

Feature-engine is a Python 3 package and works well with 3.6 or later. Earlier versions
have not been tested. The simplest way to install Feature-engine is from PyPI with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install feature-engine

Note, you can also install it with a _ as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install feature_engine

Feature-engine is an active project and routinely publishes new releases. To upgrade
Feature-engine to the latest version, use pip like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U feature-engine

If you’re using Anaconda, you can install the
`Anaconda Feature-engine package <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feature_engine>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge feature_engine
