Feature-engine
==============

A Python library for Feature Engineering and Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Feature-engine rocks!**

Feature-engine is a Python library with multiple transformers to engineer and select
features to use in machine learning models. Feature-engine preserves Scikit-learn
functionality with methods `fit()` and `transform()` to learn parameters from and then
transform the data.

Feature-engine includes transformers for:

- Missing data imputation
- Categorical encoding
- Discretisation
- Outlier capping or removal
- Variable transformation
- Variable creation
- Variable selection
- Datetime features
- Time series
- Preprocessing

Feature-engine allows you to select the variables you want to transform **within** each
transformer. This way, different engineering procedures can be easily applied to
different feature subsets.

Feature-engine transformers can be assembled within the Scikit-learn pipeline,
therefore making it possible to save and deploy one single object (.pkl) with the
entire machine learning pipeline. Check :ref:`**Quick Start** <quick_start>` for an
example.

What is unique about Feature-engine?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following characteristics make Feature-engine unique:

- Feature-engine contains the most exhaustive battery of feature engineering transformations.
- Feature-engine can transform a specific group of variables in the dataframe.
- Feature-engine returns dataframes, hence suitable for data exploration and model deployment.
- Feature-engine is compatible with the Scikit-learn pipeline.
- Feature-engine automatically recognizes numerical, categorical and datetime variables.
- Feature-engine alerts you if a transformation is not possible, e.g., if applying logarithm to negative variables or divisions by 0.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Feature-engine is a Python 3 package and works well with 3.7 or later. Earlier versions
are not compatible with the latest versions of Python numerical computing libraries.

The simplest way to install Feature-engine is from PyPI with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install feature-engine

Note, you can also install it with a _ as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install feature_engine

Feature-engine is an active project and routinely publishes new releases. To upgrade
Feature-engine to the latest version, use pip like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U feature-engine

If youâ€™re using Anaconda, you can install the
`Anaconda Feature-engine package <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feature_engine>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge feature_engine
