Feature-engine
==============

A Python library for Feature Engineering and Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Feature-engine rocks!**

Feature-engine is a Python library with multiple transformers to engineer and select
features to use in machine learning models. Feature-engine preserves Scikit-learn
functionality with methods `fit()` and `transform()` to learn parameters from and then
transform the data.

Feature-engine includes transformers for:

- Missing data imputation
- Categorical encoding
- Discretisation
- Outlier capping or removal
- Variable transformation
- Variable creation
- Variable selection
- Datetime features
- Time series
- Preprocessing

Feature-engine allows you to select the variables you want to transform **within** each
transformer. This way, different engineering procedures can be easily applied to
different feature subsets.

Feature-engine transformers can be assembled within the Scikit-learn pipeline,
therefore making it possible to save and deploy one single object (.pkl) with the
entire machine learning pipeline. Check :ref:`**Quick Start** <quick_start>` for an
example.

Pst! How did you find us?
-------------------------

We want to share Feature-engine with more people. It'd help us loads if you tell us
how you discovered us.

Then we'd know what we are doing right and which channels to use to share the love.

What is unique about Feature-engine?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following characteristics make Feature-engine unique:

- Feature-engine contains the most exhaustive collection of feature engineering transformations.
- Feature-engine can transform a specific group of variables in the dataframe.
- Feature-engine returns dataframes, hence suitable for data exploration and model deployment.
- Feature-engine is compatible with the Scikit-learn pipeline, Grid and Random search and cross validation.
- Feature-engine automatically recognizes numerical, categorical and datetime variables.
- Feature-engine alerts you if a transformation is not possible, e.g., if applying logarithm to negative variables or divisions by 0.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Feature-engine is a Python 3 package and works well with 3.7 or later. Earlier versions
are not compatible with the latest versions of Python numerical computing libraries.

The simplest way to install Feature-engine is from PyPI with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install feature-engine

Note, you can also install it with a _ as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install feature_engine

Feature-engine is an active project and routinely publishes new releases. To upgrade
Feature-engine to the latest version, use pip like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U feature-engine

If youâ€™re using Anaconda, you can install the
`Anaconda Feature-engine package <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feature_engine>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge feature_engine
