Feature-engine: A Feature Engineering for Machine Learning library
==================================================================

   Feature-engine rocks!

Feature-engine is a Python library with multiple transformers to engineer features for use
in machine learning models. Feature-engine preserves Scikit-learn functionality with fit() and 
transform() methods to learn parameters from and then transform data.

Feature-engine includes transformers for:

- Missing value imputation
- Categorical variable encoding
- Outlier capping
- Discretisation
- Numerical variable transformation

Feature-engine allows you to select the variables to engineer within each transformer. This way,
different engineering procedures can be easily applied to different feature subsets.

Feature-engine's transformers can be assembled within the Scikit-learn pipeline, therefore making it
possible to save and deploy one single object (.pkl) with the entire machine learning pipeline.

More details into what is unique about Feature-engine can be found in this article:
`Feature-engine: A new open source Python package for feature engineering <https://www.trainindata.com/post/feature-engine-a-new-open-source-python-package-for-feature-engineering>`_.


Installation
------------

Feature-engine is a Python 3 package and works well with 3.6 or later. Earlier versions have not been tested.
The simplest way to install Feature-engine is from PyPI with pip, Python's preferred package installer.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install feature-engine
