Description: # Feature Engine
        
        Feature Engine is a python library that contains several transformers to engineer features for use in machine learning models.
        The transformers follow scikit-learn like functionality. They first learn the imputing or encoding methods from the training set, and subsequently transform the dataset.
        Currently the transformers include functionality for:
        
        * Missing value imputation
        * Categorical variable encoding
        * Outlier removal
        * Discretisation
        * Numerical Variable Transformation

        ### Installing
        
        ```
        pip install feature_engine
        ```
        or
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/solegalli/feature_engine.git
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        ```
        from feature_engine.categorical_encoders import RareLabelEncoder
        
        rare_encoder = RareLabelEncoder(tol = 0.05, n_categories=5)
        rare_encoder.fit(data, variables = ['Cabin', 'Age'])
        data_encoded = rare_encoder.transform(data)
        ```
        
        See more usage examples in the jupyter notebooks in the example section
        
        ### Examples
        
        You can find jupyter notebooks in the examples folder, with directions on how to use this package and its multiple transformers.
