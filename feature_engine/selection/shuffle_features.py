class SelectByShuffling(BaseSelector):
    """
    SelectByShuffling() selects features by determining the drop in machine learning
    model performance when each feature's values are randomly shuffled.

    If the variables are important, a random permutation of their values will
    decrease dramatically the machine learning model performance. Contrarily, the
    permutation of the values should have little to no effect on the model performance
    metric we are assessing.

    The SelectByShuffling() first trains a machine learning model utilising all
    features. Next, it shuffles the values of 1 feature, obtains a prediction with the
    pre-trained model, and determines the performance drop (if any). If the drop in
    performance is bigger than a threshold then the feature is retained, otherwise
    removed. It continues until all features have been shuffled and the drop in
    performance evaluated.

    The user can determine the model for which performance drop after feature shuffling
    should be assessed. The user also determines the threshold in performance under
    which a feature will be removed, and the performance metric to evaluate.

    Model training and performance calculation are done with cross-validation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    variables : str or list, default=None
        The list of variable(s) to be shuffled from the dataframe.
        If None, the transformer will shuffle all numerical variables in the dataset.

    estimator : object, default = RandomForestClassifier()
        A Scikit-learn estimator for regression or classification.

    scoring : str, default='roc_auc'
        Desired metric to optimise the performance for the estimator. Comes from
        sklearn.metrics. See the model evaluation documentation for more options:
        https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html

    threshold : float, int, default = 0.01
        The value that defines if a feature will be kept or removed. Note that for
        metrics like roc-auc, r2_score and accuracy, the thresholds will be floats
        between 0 and 1. For metrics like the mean_square_error and the
        root_mean_square_error the threshold will be a big number.
        The threshold must be defined by the user.

    cv : int, default=3
        Desired number of cross-validation fold to be used to fit the estimator.

    Attributes
    ----------
    initial_model_performance_:
        Performance of the model trained using the original dataset.

    performance_drifts_:
        Dictionary with the performance drift per shuffled feature.

    features_to_drop_:
        List with the features to remove from the dataset.

    Methods
    -------
    fit:
        Find the important features.
    transform:
        Reduce X to the selected features.
    fit_transform:
        Fit to data, then transform it.
