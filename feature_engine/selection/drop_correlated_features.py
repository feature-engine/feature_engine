    """
    DropCorrelatedFeatures() finds and removes correlated features. Correlation is
    calculated with `pandas.corr()`. Features are removed on first found first removed
    basis, without any further insight.

    DropCorrelatedFeatures() works only with numerical variables. Categorical variables
    will need to be encoded to numerical or will be excluded from the analysis.

    More details in the :ref:`User Guide <drop_correlated>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    {variables}

    method: string or callable, default='pearson'
        Can take 'pearson', 'spearman', 'kendall' or callable. It refers to the
        correlation method to be used to identify the correlated features.

        - 'pearson': standard correlation coefficient
        - 'kendall': Kendall Tau correlation coefficient
        - 'spearman': Spearman rank correlation
        - callable: callable with input two 1d ndarrays and returning a float.

        For more details on this parameter visit the  `pandas.corr()` documentation.

    threshold: float, default=0.8
        The correlation threshold above which a feature will be deemed correlated with
        another one and removed from the dataset.

    {missing_values}

    {confirm_variables}

    Attributes
    ----------
    features_to_drop_:
        Set with the correlated features that will be dropped.

    correlated_feature_sets_:
        Groups of correlated features. Each list is a group of correlated features.

    {variables_}

    {feature_names_in_}

    {n_features_in_}

    Methods
    -------
    fit:
        Find correlated features.

    {fit_transform}

    {get_support}

    transform:
        Remove correlated features.

    Notes
    -----
    If you want to select from each group of correlated features those that are perhaps
    more predictive or more complete, check Feature-engine's SmartCorrelationSelection.
