class DropCorrelatedFeatures(BaseSelector):
    """
    DropCorrelatedFeatures() finds and removes correlated features. Correlation is
    calculated with `pandas.corr()`.

    Features are removed on first found first removed basis, without any further
    insight.

    DropCorrelatedFeatures() works only with numerical variables. Categorical variables
    will need to be encoded to numerical or will be excluded from the analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    variables: list, default=None
        The list of variables to evaluate. If None, the transformer will evaluate all
        numerical variables in the dataset.

    method: string, default='pearson'
        Can take 'pearson', 'spearman' or'kendall'. It refers to the correlation method
        to be used to identify the correlated features.

        - pearson : standard correlation coefficient
        - kendall : Kendall Tau correlation coefficient
        - spearman : Spearman rank correlation

    threshold: float, default=0.8
        The correlation threshold above which a feature will be deemed correlated with
        another one and removed from the dataset.

    missing_values: str, default=ignore
        Takes values 'raise' and 'ignore'. Whether the missing values should be raised
        as error or ignored when determining correlation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    features_to_drop_:
        Set with the correlated features that will be dropped.

    correlated_feature_sets_:
        Groups of correlated features. Each list is a group of correlated features.

    variables_:
        The variables to consider for the feature selection.

    n_features_in_:
        The number of features in the train set used in fit.

    Methods
    -------
    fit:
        Find correlated features.
    transform:
        Remove correlated features.
    fit_transform:
        Fit to the data. Then transform it.
