class DropCorrelatedFeatures(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """
    DropCorrelatedFeatures finds and removes correlated features.

    Features are removed on first found first removed basis, without any further
    insight.

    DropCorrelatedFeatures() works only with numerical variables. Categorical variables
    will need to be encoded to numerical or will be excluded from the analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------

    variables: list, default=None
        The list of variables to evaluate. If None, the transformer will evaluate all
        numerical variables in the dataset.

    method: string, default='pearson'
        Can take 'pearson', 'spearman' or'kendall'. It refers to the correlation method
        to be used to identify the correlated features.

        pearson : standard correlation coefficient
        kendall : Kendall Tau correlation coefficient
        spearman : Spearman rank correlation

        See
        https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/
        pandas.DataFrame.corr.html
        for more details.

    threshold: float, default=0.8
        The correlation threshold above which a feature will be deemed correlated with
        another one and removed from the dataset.

    Attributes
    ----------

    correlated_features_: set
        The correlated features.

    correlated_feature_sets_: list
        Groups of correlated features. Or in other words, features that are
        correlated with each other. Each list represents a group of correlated
        features.

    correlated_matrix_: pandas dataframe
        The correlated matrix.

    Methods
    -------

     fit: finds the correlated features

     transform: removes correlated features

     fit_transform: finds and removes correlated features
