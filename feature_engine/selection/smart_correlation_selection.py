class SmartCorrelatedSelection(BaseSelector):
    """
    SmartCorrelatedSelection() finds groups of correlated features and then selects,
    from each group, a feature following certain criteria:

    - Feature with least missing values
    - Feature with most unique values
    - Feature with highest variance
    - Feature with highest importance according to an estimator

    SmartCorrelatedSelection() returns a dataframe containing from each group of
    correlated features, the selected variable, plus all original features that were
    not correlated to any other.

    Correlation is calculated with `pandas.corr()`.

    SmartCorrelatedSelection() works only with numerical variables. Categorical
    variables will need to be encoded to numerical or will be excluded from the
    analysis.

    More details in the :ref:`User Guide <smart_correlation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    {variables}

    method: string or callable, default='pearson'
        Can take 'pearson', 'spearman', 'kendall' or callable. It refers to the
        correlation method to be used to identify the correlated features.

        - 'pearson': standard correlation coefficient
        - 'kendall': Kendall Tau correlation coefficient
        - 'spearman': Spearman rank correlation
        - callable: callable with input two 1d ndarrays and returning a float.

        For more details on this parameter visit the `pandas.corr()` documentation.

    threshold: float, default=0.8
        The correlation threshold above which a feature will be deemed correlated with
        another one and removed from the dataset.

    {missing_values}

    selection_method: str, default= "missing_values"
        Takes the values "missing_values", "cardinality", "variance" and
        "model_performance".

        **"missing_values"**: keeps the feature from the correlated group with least
        missing observations

        **"cardinality"**: keeps the feature from the correlated group with the highest
        cardinality.

        **"variance"**: keeps the feature from the correlated group with the highest
        variance.

        **"model_performance"**: trains a machine learning model using the correlated
        feature group and retains the feature with the highest importance.

    {estimator}

    {scoring}

    {cv}

    {confirm_variables}

    Attributes
    ----------
    correlated_feature_sets_:
        Groups of correlated features. Each list is a group of correlated features.

    features_to_drop_:
        The correlated features to remove from the dataset.

    {variables_}

    {feature_names_in_}

    {n_features_in_}

    Methods
    -------
    fit:
        Find best feature from each correlated group.

    {fit_transform}

    {get_support}

    transform:
        Return selected features.

    -----
    For brute-force correlation selection, check Feature-engine's
    DropCorrelatedFeatures().
