class DropHighPSIFeatures(BaseSelector):
    r"""
    DropHighPSIFeatures drops features which Population Stability Index (PSI) value is
    above a given threshold. The PSI of a numerical feature is an indication of the
    shift in its distribution; a feature with high PSI could therefore be considered
    unstable.

    A bigger PSI value indicates a bigger shift in the feature distribution.

    Different thresholds can be used to assess the magnitude of the distribution shift
    according to the PSI value. The most commonly used thresholds are:

    - Below 10%, the variable has not experienced a significant shift.
    - Above 25%, the variable has experienced a major shift.
    - Between those two values, the shift is intermediate.

    To compute the PSI the DropHighPSIFeatures splits the dataset in two:

    First and foremost, the user should enter one variable which will be used to guide
    the data split. This variable can be of any data type. If the user does not enter a
    variable name, DropHighPSIFeatures will use the dataframe index.

    Second, the user has the option to specify a proportion of observations to put in
    each data set, or alternatively, provide a cut-off value.

    If the user specifies a proportion through the `split_frac` parameter, the data will
    be sorted to accommodate that proportion. If `split_frac` is 0.5, 50% of the
    observations will go to either basis or test sets. If `split_frac` is 0.6, 60% of
    the samples will go to the basis data set and the remaining 40% to the test set.

    If `split_distinct` is True, the data will be sorted considering unique values in
    the selected variables. Check the parameter below for more details.

    If the user defines a numeric cut-off value or a specific date using the `cut_off`
    parameter, the observations with value <= cut-off will go to the basis data set and
    the remaining ones to the test set. For categorical values this means they are
    sorted alphabetically and cut accordingly.

    If the user passes a list of values in the `cut-off`, the observations with the
    values in the list, will go to the basis set, and the remaining ones to the test
    set.

    More details in the :ref:`User Guide <psi_selection>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    split_col: string or int, default=None.
        The variable that will be used to split the dataset into the basis and test
        sets. If None, the dataframe index will be used. `split_col` can be a numerical,
        categorical or datetime variable. If `split_col` is a categorical variable, and
        the splitting criteria is given by `split_frac`, it will be assumed that the
        labels of the variable are sorted alphabetically.

    split_frac: float, default=0.5.
        The proportion of observations in each of the basis and test dataframes. If
        `split_frac` is 0.6, 60% of the observations will be put in the basis data set.

        If `split_distinct` is True, the indicated fraction may not be achieved exactly.
        See parameter `split_distinct` for more details.

        If `cut_off` is not None, `split_frac` will be ignored and the data split based
        on the `cut_off` value.

    split_distinct: boolean, default=False.
        If True, `split_frac` is applied to the vector of unique values in `split_col`
        instead of being applied to the whole vector of values. For example, if the
        values in `split_col` are [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] and `split_frac` is
        0.5, we have the following:
        - `split_distinct=False` splits the vector in two equally sized parts:
        [1, 1, 1, 1] and [2, 2, 3, 4]. This involves that 2 dataframes with 4
        observations each are used for the PSI calculations.
        - `split_distinct=True` computes the vector of unique values in `split_col`
        ([1, 2, 3, 4]) and splits that vector in two equal parts: [1, 2] and [3, 4].
        The number of observations in the two dataframes used for the PSI calculations
        is respectively 6 ([1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]) and 2 ([3, 4]).

    cut_off: int, float, date or list, default=None
        Threshold to split the dataset based on the `split_col` variable. If int, float
        or date, observations where the `split_col` values are <= threshold will
        go to the basis data set and the rest to the test set. If `cut_off` is a list,
        the observations where the `split_col` values are within the list will go to the
        basis data set and the remaining observations to the test set. If `cut_off` is
        not None, this parameter will be used to split the data and `split_frac` will be
        ignored.

    switch: boolean, default=False.
        If True, the order of the 2 dataframes used to determine the PSI (basis and
        test) will be switched. This is important because the PSI is not symmetric,
        i.e., PSI(a, b) != PSI(b, a)).

    threshold: float, str, default = 0.25.
        The threshold to drop a feature. If the PSI for a feature is >= threshold, the
        feature will be dropped. The most common threshold values are 0.25 (large shift)
        and 0.10 (medium shift).
        If 'auto', the threshold will be calculated based on the size of the base and
        target dataset and the number of bins.

    bins: int, default = 10
        Number of bins or intervals. For continuous features with good value spread, 10
        bins is commonly used. For features with lower cardinality or highly skewed
        distributions, lower values may be required.

    strategy: string, default='equal_frequency'
        If the intervals into which the features should be discretized are of equal
        size or equal number of observations. Takes values "equal_width" for equally
        spaced bins or "equal_frequency" for bins based on quantiles, that is, bins
        with similar number of observations.

    min_pct_empty_bins: float, default = 0.0001
        Value to add to empty bins or intervals. If after sorting the variable
        values into bins, a bin is empty, the PSI cannot be determined. By adding a
        small number to empty bins, we can avoid this issue. Note, that if the value
        added is too large, it may disturb the PSI calculation.

    missing_values: str, default='raise'
        Whether to perform the PSI feature selection on a dataframe with missing values.
        Takes values 'raise' or 'ignore'. If 'ignore', missing values will be dropped
        when determining the PSI for that particular feature. If 'raise' the transformer
        will raise an error and features will not be selected.

            used to compute the quantile. The value with the quantile that
            is the closest to the chosen split fraction is used as cut-off.

            - The procedure assumes that categorical values are sorted alphabetically
            and cut accordingly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        split_column : pd.Series.
            Series for which the nth quantile will be computed.

        Returns
        -------
        cut_off: (float, int, str, object).
            value for the cut-off.
