class TargetMeanClassifier(BaseTargetMeanEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    """
    The TargetMeanClassifier estimates the target value based on the mean target value
    per category or bin, across a group of variables.

    The TargetMeanClassifier takes both numerical and categorical variables as input.
    For numerical variables, the values are first sorted into bins of equal-width or
    equal-frequency. Then, the mean target value is estimated for each bin. If the
    variables are categorical, the mean target value is estimated for each category.
    Finally, the estimator takes the average of the mean target value across the
    input variables and determines the class based on a threshold of 0.5.

    Parameters
    ----------
    variables: list, default=None
        The list of input variables. If None, the estimator will use all variables as
        input features (except datetime).

    bins: int, default=5
        If the dataset contains numerical variables, the number of bins into which
        the values will be sorted.

    strategy: str, default='equal_width'
        Whether the bins should of equal width ('equal_width') or equal frequency
        ('equal_frequency').

    Attributes
    ----------
    variables_categorical_:
        The group of categorical input variables that will be used for prediction.

    variables_numerical_:
        The group of numerical input variables that will be used for prediction.

    classes_:
        A list of class labels known to the classifier.

    pipeline_:
        A Sickit-learn Pipeline with a dicretiser and/or encoder. Used to determine the
        mean target value per category or bin, per variable.

    n_features_in_:
        The number of features in the train set used in fit.

    Methods
    -------
    fit:
        Learn the mean target value per category or per bin, for each variable.

    predict:
        Predict class labels for samples in X.

    predict_log_proba:
        Predict logarithm of probability estimates.

    predict_proba:
        Proxy for Probability estimates based of the average of the target mean value
         across variables.

    score:
        Return the mean accuracy on the given test data and labels.
