class MathematicalCombination(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """
    MathematicalCombination() applies basic mathematical operations to multiple
    features, returning one or more additional features as a result. That is, it sums,
    multiplies, takes the average, maximum, minimum or standard deviation of a group
    of variables, and returns the result into new variables.

    For example, if we have the variables **number_payments_first_quarter**,
    **number_payments_second_quarter**, **number_payments_third_quarter** and
    **number_payments_fourth_quarter**, we can use MathematicalCombination() to
    calculate the total number of payments and mean number of payments as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        transformer = MathematicalCombination(
            variables_to_combine=[
                'number_payments_first_quarter',
                'number_payments_second_quarter',
                'number_payments_third_quarter',
                'number_payments_fourth_quarter'
            ],
            math_operations=[
                'sum',
                'mean'
            ],
            new_variables_name=[
                'total_number_payments',
                'mean_number_payments'
            ]
        )

        Xt = transformer.fit_transform(X)

    The transformed X, Xt, will contain the additional features
    **total_number_payments** and **mean_number_payments**, plus the original set of
    variables.

    Attention, if some of the variables to combine have missing data and
    `missing_values = 'ignore'`, the value will be ignored in the computation. To be
    clear, if variables A, B and C, have values 10, 20 and NA, and we perform the sum,
    the result will be A + B = 30.

    Parameters
    ----------
    variables_to_combine: list
        The list of numerical variables to be combined.

    math_operations: list, default=None
        The list of basic math operations to be used to create the new features.

        If None, all of ['sum', 'prod', 'mean', 'std', 'max', 'min'] will be performed
        over the `variables_to_combine`. Alternatively, you can enter the list of
        operations to carry out.

        Each operation should be a string and must be one of the elements
        in `['sum', 'prod', 'mean', 'std', 'max', 'min']`.

        Each operation will result in a new variable that will be added to the
        transformed dataset.

    new_variables_names: list, default=None
        Names of the newly created variables. You can enter a name or a list
        of names for the newly created features (recommended). You must enter
        one name for each mathematical transformation indicated in the `math_operations`
        parameter. That is, if you want to perform mean and sum of features, you
        should enter 2 new variable names. If you perform only mean of features,
        enter 1 variable name. Alternatively, if you chose to perform all
        mathematical transformations, enter 6 new variable names.

        The name of the variables indicated by the user should coincide with the order
        in which the mathematical operations are initialised in the transformer.
        That is, if you set math_operations = ['mean', 'prod'], the first new variable
        name will be assigned to the mean of the variables and the second variable name
        to the product of the variables.

        If `new_variable_names = None`, the transformer will assign an arbitrary name
        to the newly created features starting by the name of the mathematical
        operation, followed by the variables combined separated by -.

    missing_values: string, default='raise'
        Indicates if missing values should be ignored or raised. If 'raise' the
        transformer will return an error if the the datasets to fit or transform
        contain missing values. If 'ignore', missing data will be ignored when
        performing the calculations.

    Attributes
    ----------
    combination_dict_:
        Dictionary containing the mathematical operation to new variable name pairs.

    math_operations_:
        List with the mathematical operations to be applied to the
        `variables_to_combine`.

    n_features_in_:
        The number of features in the train set used in fit.

    Methods
    -------
    fit:
        This transformer does not learn parameters.
    transform:
        Combine the variables with the mathematical operations.
    fit_transform:
        Fit to the data, then transform it.

    Notes
    -----
    Although the transformer in essence allows us to combine any feature with any of
    the allowed mathematical operations, its used is intended mostly for the creation
    of new features based on some domain knowledge. Typical examples within the
    financial sector are:

    - Sum debt across financial products, i.e., credit cards, to obtain the total debt.
    - Take the average payments to various financial products per month.
    - Find the Minimum payment done at any one month.

    In insurance, we can sum the damage to various parts of a car to obtain the
    total damage.
