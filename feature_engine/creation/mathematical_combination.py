class MathematicalCombination(BaseNumericalTransformer):
    """
    MathematicalCombination() applies basic mathematical operations across features,
    returning 1 or more additional features as a result.

    For example, if we have the variables number_payments_first_quarter,
    number_payments_second_quarter, number_payments_third_quarter and
    number_payments_fourth_quarter, we can use MathematicalCombination() to calculate
    the total number of payments and mean number of payments as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        transformer = MathematicalCombination(
            variables=[
                'number_payments_first_quarter',
                'number_payments_second_quarter',
                'number_payments_third_quarter',
                'number_payments_fourth_quarter'
            ],
            math_operations=[
                'sum',
                'mean'
            ],
            new_variables_name=[
                'total_number_payments',
                'mean_number_payments'
            ]
        )

        transformer.fit_transform(X)

    The transformed X will contain the additional features total_number_payments and
    mean_number_payments, plus the original set of variables.

    Parameters
    ----------

    variables: list, default=None
        The list of numerical variables to be combined. If None, the transformer
        will find and select all numerical variables.

    math_operations: list, default=None
        The list of basic math operations to be used in transformation.

        If none, all of ['sum', 'prod', 'mean', 'std', 'max', 'min'] will be performed
        over the variables. Alternatively, user can enter the list of operations to
        carry out.

        Each operation should be a string and must be one of the elements
        from the list: ['sum', 'prod', 'mean', 'std', 'max', 'min']

        Each operation will result in a new variable that will be added to the
        transformed dataset.

    new_variables_names: list, default=None
        Names of the newly created variables. The user can enter a name or a list
        of names for the newly created features (recommended). User must enter
        one name for each mathematical transformation indicated in the math_operations
        attribute. That is, if you want to perform mean and sum of features, you
        should enter 2 new variable names. If you perform only mean of features,
        enter 1 variable name. Alternatively, if you chose to perform all
        mathematical transformations, enter 6 new variable names.

        The name of the variables indicated by the user should coincide with the order
        in which the mathematical operations are initialised in the transformer.
        That is, if you set math_operations = ['mean', 'prod'], the first new variable
        name will be assigned to the mean of the variables and the second variable name
        to the product of the variables.

        If new_variable_names=None, the transformer will assign an arbitrary name
        to the newly created features starting by the name of the mathematical
        operation, followed by the variables combined separated by -.
